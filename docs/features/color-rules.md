# Color Rules

Color rules apply conditional formatting to grid cells, making patterns and anomalies visually obvious at a glance.

## Creating Color Rules

1. Open **View → Color Rules** or `Cmd+Click` a cell and select **Create Color Rule**
2. Configure the rule:
   - **Column** — which column to evaluate (or "Any Column")
   - **Condition** — matching logic (see below)
   - **Value** — the pattern or text to match
   - **Background color** — cell highlight color
   - **Foreground color** — text color

### Condition Types

| Condition | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Contains** | Substring match (case-insensitive) | `powershell` |
| **Equals** | Exact match | `4624` |
| **Starts with** | Prefix match | `C:\Windows\Temp` |
| **Regex** | Regular expression | `(?i)invoke-\w+` |

## Rule Ordering

Rules are evaluated top to bottom. The first matching rule wins for each cell. Drag rules in the editor to reorder priority.

## KAPE-Aware Presets

IRFlow Timeline includes pre-built color rule sets for common DFIR artifacts:

### Suspicious Process Indicators

| Pattern | Color | Detects |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `powershell` | Red | PowerShell execution |
| `mimikatz` | Red | Credential dumping |
| `lsass` | Red | LSASS access |
| `cmd.exe` | Orange | Command shell |
| `wscript` / `cscript` | Orange | Script hosts |
| `certutil` | Orange | LOLBin abuse |
| `bitsadmin` | Orange | LOLBin abuse |
| `mshta` | Orange | LOLBin abuse |
| `rundll32` | Yellow | Suspicious execution |
| `regsvr32` | Yellow | Suspicious execution |

### Path-Based Rules

| Pattern | Color | Detects |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `\Temp\` | Yellow | Temp directory execution |
| `\AppData\` | Yellow | User profile execution |
| `\Downloads\` | Yellow | Downloaded file execution |
| `\ProgramData\` | Yellow | Unusual execution path |

## Auto-Color Palette

When a KAPE profile is detected, IRFlow Timeline can automatically generate color rules based on unique values in a designated column. For example, EvtxECmd output can be auto-colored by `Channel` so that Security, Sysmon, System, and Application events each have a distinct background color.

## Performance

Color rules are pre-compiled into optimized matching functions when created or modified. This means:

- Regex patterns are compiled once, not on every cell evaluation
- Contains/equals/starts with/ends with use fast string operations
- Rules are evaluated per-visible-row only (virtual scrolling means only ~50 rows need evaluation at a time)

## Managing Rules

- **Edit** — click a rule in the list to modify it
- **Delete** — remove rules you no longer need
- **Enable/Disable** — toggle rules without deleting them
- **Import/Export** — rules are saved and restored with [sessions](/workflows/sessions)
