# Log Source Coverage

Log Source Coverage provides a Gantt-style visualization of which log sources are present across your timeline, their time spans, and event counts — helping you identify collection gaps and verify evidence completeness.

![Log Source Coverage Map showing coverage timeline across 138 log sources with event counts and time spans](/dfir-tips/Log-Source-Coverage.png)

## Opening Log Source Coverage

- **Menu:** **Tools → Analysis → Log Sources**

## Configuration

### Source Column

Select the column that identifies your log sources. The dropdown auto-detects and suggests common source columns:

| Auto-Detected Pattern | Typical Tool |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `Provider` | EvtxECmd, EVTX |
| `Channel` | EvtxECmd, EVTX |
| `source` / `Source` / `_Source` | Plaso, merged timelines |
| `data_type` / `DataType` | Plaso |
| `parser` | Plaso |
| `log_source` | Generic |
| `EventLog` | Hayabusa, Chainsaw |
| `SourceName` / `SourceLong` | EvtxECmd |
| `ArtifactName` | KAPE tools |
| `sourcetype` | Splunk exports |

Other columns are available below the suggested list.

### Timestamp Column

Select which timestamp column to use for time span calculation from your detected timestamp columns.

## What It Shows

After analysis, the coverage map displays each log source as a horizontal row with:

- **Source name** — the log source identifier (clickable)
- **Gantt bar** — visual bar spanning from the source's earliest to latest event, scaled to the global timeline range. Bar color uses heatmap intensity based on event count percentile
- **Event count** — total events for that source
- **Time range** — earliest and latest timestamps (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM format)
- **Duration** — time span of that source's data, formatted as minutes, hours, or days (e.g., `45m`, `3h 20m`, `2d 5h`)

Sources are sorted by event count descending by default, placing the most active sources at the top.

## Summary Cards

Two metrics appear above the results:

- **Log sources** — number of distinct sources detected
- **Total events** — total events across all sources

## Click-to-Filter

Click any source row to filter the main data grid to events from that source only. This provides a fast workflow for investigating individual log sources.

## Identifying Gaps

Coverage gaps are visually apparent as missing or short bars compared to the global timeline span. Common patterns:

| Gap Pattern | Possible Cause |
|-------------|---------------|
| Single source goes dark while others continue | Log tampering, service stopped |
| All sources go dark simultaneously | System offline, power loss |
| Source starts later than others | Collection began after incident |
| Source ends earlier than others | Collection stopped prematurely |
| Source has a narrow bar despite long timeline | Intermittent logging, rotation issues |

## Filter Awareness

Log source coverage respects all active filters — column filters, checkbox filters, date range filters, search terms, advanced filters, and bookmark filters. This lets you analyze coverage within a specific time window or for a subset of events.

## Investigation Workflow

1. Open Log Source Coverage to get the big picture of your data
2. Identify any gaps in expected log sources
3. Cross-reference with [Gap Analysis](/features/gap-burst-analysis) for precise gap timestamps
4. Verify whether gaps align with known maintenance windows or are suspicious
5. Click sources of interest to drill into their events

## Tips

::: tip Evidence Validation
Run coverage analysis early in your investigation to ensure you have complete data before drawing conclusions. Missing log sources can lead to incorrect timelines.
:::

::: tip Multi-Source Correlation
When merging multiple timelines, check coverage to ensure overlapping time ranges. Sources that don't overlap in time provide limited correlation value.
:::

::: tip Compare Host-by-Host
In merged multi-host timelines, filter to each host before running coverage analysis. This reveals per-host collection quality and helps identify hosts with incomplete evidence.
