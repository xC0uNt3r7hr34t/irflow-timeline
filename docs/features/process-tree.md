# Process Inspector

The Process Inspector builds parent-child process trees from **Sysmon Event ID 1** and **Windows Security Event ID 4688**, then scores execution chains with chain rules, standalone detections, prevalence, binary trust, lifetime, injection, and privilege-use correlation. Results open as **Story / Triage / Hunt / Graph / Raw** views plus a **Rules** health report, with analyst suppressions, custom rules, and one-click pivots into the main grid and other IRFlow features.

## Opening the Process Inspector

- **Menu:** **Tools → Platforms → Windows → Process Inspector**
- **Home:** Process Inspector capability tile (when a tab is ready)
- Supports Sysmon EID 1 and Security EID 4688 from EVTX, EvtxECmd CSV, Hayabusa, Chainsaw process exports, and similar timeline imports
- Default event filter: `1,4688`
- Configurable max processes (default **200,000**)

## Supported formats

| Format | How PI maps fields |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Raw Sysmon / Security** | Direct columns (`Image`, `ProcessGuid`, `CommandLine`, …) |
| **Security 4688** | Reversed PID semantics (`NewProcessId` = child, `ProcessId` = parent); `NewProcessName`, `TargetUserName`, elevation / integrity labels |
| **EvtxECmd (KAPE)** | Real PID/GUID extracted from `PayloadData1` / `PayloadData5`; image/cmdline from `ExecutableInfo`. Provider filter keeps Sysmon + Security only |
| **Hayabusa** | Compact KV in `Details` / `ExtraFieldInfo` |
| **Chainsaw process** | Nested `Event.EventData.*` aliases |

Auto-detected columns include PID/PPID, GUIDs, Image/ParentImage, CommandLine, User, UtcTime, EventID, Provider, Hostname, elevation/integrity, hashes, OriginalFileName, signer metadata, and ProcessAccess privilege fields when present.

## How the tree is built

1. **GUID-preferred linking** — `ProcessGuid` ↔ `ParentProcessGuid` (survives PID reuse). Header shows **GUID-linked** when this is the primary mode.
2. **Scoped PID fallback** — when GUIDs are missing, re-link by host + LogonId/SessionId + PID with time ordering (parent must precede child). Link provenance is stored per node (`guid` / `pid-logon` / `pid-session` / `pid-host` / `unresolved` / `root`).
3. **Parent image backfill** — 4688 rows without ParentImage inherit the linked parent’s path.
4. **Enrichment passes** (best-effort, same table):
   - **Terminate** — Sysmon EID **5** / Security **4689** → duration
   - **Process Access** — Sysmon EID **10** → injection / hollowing indicators (`VM_WRITE` near create)
   - **Privilege use** — Security **4673** / **4674** → SeDebug, SeLoadDriver, multi-priv concentration
   - **Network** — Sysmon EID **3** → outbound connection counts / destinations
   - **DNS** — Sysmon EID **22** → query counts / sample names
   - **Image load** — Sysmon EID **7** → unsigned / writable-path module counts
   - **File create** — Sysmon EID **11** → PE/script drops in user-writable paths

Missing enrichment EIDs do not fail the build; the verdict hero reports telemetry completeness.

## Detection engine

### Chain rules (~330 parent→child pairs)

Indexed O(1) lookup from `src/detection-rules.js`, mapped to MITRE ATT&CK. Examples: Office → shell, web server → shell, LOLBins, WMI/PsExec lateral, browser → PowerShell.

Some interpreter chains are **gated**: benign `svchost→powershell` / `cmd→powershell` demote to **context** unless command-line corroboration exists. High-confidence chains (Office → shell, LSASS children) stay primary.

### Standalone + context rules (PI rule catalog)

Implemented in `src/utils/process-inspector.js` (~60 `pi-*` rules, including path masquerade, binary trust, lifetime, and grandparent chains) across groups:

| Group | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Execution** | Encoded / stealth PowerShell, download cradles, AMSI/ETW patch keywords |
| **Defense evasion** | LOLBin download/decode, living-off-the-land staging |
| **Credential access** | LSASS tools, procdump, secretsdump patterns |
| **Persistence** | Scheduled task / service install patterns in cmdline |
| **Lateral movement** | WinRM, WMI remote, PsExec |
| **RMM / exfil** | AnyDesk, rclone, etc. (with sanctioned-path dampening) |
| **Discovery** | whoami, AD recon tools |
| **Trust** | Unsigned in trusted paths, OriginalFileName rename, cross-host hash mismatch |
| **Lifetime** | Short-lived respawns, missing terminate on offensive tools |
| **Misc** | Injection (EID 10), privilege concentration (4673/4674) |

**Allowlist** (`PI_ALLOWLIST`) dampens known-good EDR/AV/RMM/update agents under trusted roots (with `cmdUntrust` for abusive LOLBin shapes such as `MpCmdRun -DownloadFile`).

**Prevalence** boosts rare host/command patterns. **Custom rules** are analyst-supplied regexes (with ReDoS guards) defined **inside Process Inspector** — not in the Persistence Analyzer.

### Grandparent multi-hop chains (pi-60)

Exact triples such as `winword → cmd → powershell` fire on the leaf even when intermediate hops were demoted by the chain FP gate. Walk uses `consistentParentKey` so PID-reuse edges do not invent false Office→shell paths.

### Multi-stage sequences

Sliding ~10-minute windows promote multi-behavior attack stories, for example:

- Download → Execute  
- Office/Script → LOLBin  
- Recon → Lateral  
- Credential Access → Lateral / LSASS dump → Lateral  
- Multi-hop LOLBIN chain  
- Office/Script → Download → RMM  
- AMSI/ETW patch → Inject  
- Disable Defender → Payload  
- Download/Stage → Persistence  
- Suspicious Exec → Network/DNS  
- Drop File/Module → Execute  

Sequences appear as **SEQ** badges and feed Story mode.

## View modes

| Mode | What you see |
|------|----------------|
| **Story** | Investigation stories (host/user narrative, techniques, steps) |
| **Triage** | Suspicious chain clusters, risk-sorted |
| **Hunt** | Medium+ clusters |
| **Graph** | Spatial parent-child graph (multi-host swimlanes, pan/zoom). Seed severity filter; click node → detail panel |
| **Raw** | Full hierarchical tree / flat list with column filters |
| **Rules** | Rule health & coverage report (fired / silent / disabled built-in + custom + sequences) |

Toolbar: search, severity toggles, expand/depth (tree modes), copy/export, rare-process chips, **Rules** coverage toggle.

### Story

Grouped investigation narratives — host, user, ATT&CK techniques, and the steps that make up each story. Open a row for Event Details and pivot into Graph or Raw.

![Process Inspector Story — 81 stories on WKS2390, OneDriveSetup and DumpIt.exe leads, Event Timeline](/dfir-tips/Process-Inspector-Story.png)

### Triage

Suspicious chain clusters, risk-sorted. Use this after Story when you want every high/medium parent→child cluster without the narrative grouping.

![Process Inspector Triage — 61 chains, DumpIt.exe, gkape→kape, cmd→andromeda, skype.exe](/dfir-tips/Process-Inspector-Triage.png)

### Hunt

Medium+ clusters plus **Rare processes** chips (prevalence leads). Toggle **Show Rare Only** to hide common noise.

![Process Inspector Hunt — 38 high chains with Rare processes chips for DumpIt, OneDrive, kape, andromeda](/dfir-tips/Process-Inspector-Hunt.png)

### Graph

Spatial parent-child graph. Seed by severity (Med+ / High+ / Critical / All), pan/zoom, click a node for Event Details. Ancestry and descendants stay in view even when they fall below the seed filter.

### Raw

Full hierarchical tree (or flat list) with column filters, expand/depth, **Suspicious Only**, and the Event Details pane. **Filter Grid**, **Graph**, **Lateral**, **Persistence**, and **Sigma** sit on the selected node.

![Process Inspector Raw — GUID-linked tree of cortex-xdr-payload.exe → cmd.exe with Event Details and Filter Grid / Sigma handoffs](/dfir-tips/Process-Inspector-Raw.png)

### Rule health report

After a build, open **Rules** in the results toolbar for a coverage brief:

- Coverage % of enabled built-in rules that fired on this tree  
- Fired / silent / disabled counts, custom-rule hits, sequence hits  
- Top fired rules, silent high-value (critical/high with zero hits), by-group breakdown  
- Techniques seen; copy or download a plain-text report (`process-rule-health.txt`)  

Use this to tune intents (Low-noise / Balanced / Broad), spot telemetry gaps (silent high-value rules on a clean-looking host), and document which detections applied to a case. Toggle **Rules** again to return to the previous view mode.

![Process Inspector Rules — 15% coverage, fired vs silent high-value rules, by-group breakdown, and sequence hits](/dfir-tips/Process-Inspector-Rules.png)

### Config phase (before build)

![Process Inspector config — tree-ready mapping, Balanced intent, technique-group toggles, Sysmon 1,258 events, GUID linking](/dfir-tips/Process-Inspector-Config.png)

Before the tree runs, the config panel surfaces:

- **Readiness score** and detection capability chips (tree reconstruction, chain detections, standalone, sequences)
- **Telemetry toggles** — Sysmon EID 1 and Security 4688, with live event counts from preview
- **Intent presets** — Low-noise triage, Balanced, or Broad hunt (adjusts which `pi-*` groups are disabled)
- **Technique groups** — enable/disable rule groups with partial-state support
- **Custom rules** — parent/child name, path/cmdline contains, optional regex (ReDoS-guarded), severity, MITRE, behavior tag
- **Column mapping** disclosure when auto-map needs override
- Max process limit (default **200,000**)

### Verdict hero (results)

On build complete, a **verdict-first** banner shows:

- Worst severity + headline (top story or detection summary)
- Counts (critical / high / medium / total processes)
- Top stories (jump to Story view)
- ATT&CK technique chips
- Link quality (GUID vs PID)
- Telemetry completeness (Process Create · Terminate · Process Access · Privilege Use)
- Truncation warning when the max process limit was hit
- **Scoped rebuild** — host and/or time window when the global max truncated the tree

## Detail panel

The Event Details pane is shared across Story, Triage, Hunt, Graph, and Raw. Graph and Raw screenshots above show it populated.

Select a process for:

- Detection reason, confidence, triage score, evidence pills, MITRE badges  
- Fields: path, parent, link provenance, prevalence, integrity, cmdline (token highlight + base64 decode)  
- Source event, Related EVTX timeline, cross-telemetry pivots  
- **Filter Grid** — ProcessGuid (or host+PID) ± time window, including child creates; optional scroll to create event  
- **Graph** — focus this process in Graph mode  
- **Open Lateral / Persistence / Sigma** — time+host context handoffs  
- **VirusTotal** — in-app lookup when a VT API key is configured; otherwise opens the public VT page  
- Baseline / Suppress (Analyst Profile)

## Grid pivot (Filter Grid)

One click from a process:

1. Prefer **ProcessGuid contains** (and ParentProcessGuid for children)  
2. Else **PID** (decimal + hex) + PPID, scoped by hostname when available  
3. Always apply **±N minutes** on the timestamp column when parseable (5m / 15m / 1h / 6h)  
4. Clears competing search/column filters so the pivot is deterministic  
5. Sets the proximity pill and, when possible, **scrolls to the create event**

Works with EvtxECmd/Hayabusa blob columns via `contains` on the payload field.

## Cross-feature handoffs

From the detail panel (time window default ±30m, host-scoped when possible):

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Open Lateral Movement** | Applies host + time filters on the tab, opens LM, auto-runs analysis |
| **Search Persistence** | Same context window, opens Persistence Analyzer, auto-runs |
| **Sigma around selection** | Same context window, opens Sigma wizard on **current tab** (tune profile and run) |

## Analyst Profile

Suppressions and baselines (process, parent, host, user, image, cmdline contains, reason). Save/Load JSON profiles. See [Analyst Profiles](/features/analyst-profiles).

**Custom detection rules** live in the Process Inspector config panel under **Custom Rules**. Each rule can match any combination of:

- Parent process name  
- Process name  
- Image path contains  
- Command line contains  
- Optional regex (process / cmdline / path)  
- Severity, MITRE technique, and **behavior tag** (so the rule participates in sequence detection)

## Exports

- CSV / JSON of visible processes (with link provenance and detection fields)  
- Copy chain / tree / selected rows / stories  
- Linked evidence export from Related EVTX pivots  

## Scale & rebuild

- Tree build runs in an **analyzer worker** (job-backed).  
- Detection scoring runs **chunked asynchronously** after the tree returns (progress bar in the hero on large sets) so the UI stays responsive.  
- When the process limit truncates results, the hero offers a **scoped rebuild**: pick host and/or time window and re-run without raising the global max.  

## Limitations

- Windows process-create focused (Sysmon 1 / Security 4688). Linux/macOS process telemetry is not modeled.  
- Graph and detection score **cap** large trees (default 200k processes; graph seeds ~220 nodes). Truncation is warned in the hero and header.  
- EID 10 / 5 / 3 / 22 / 7 / 11 / 4673 enrichment requires those events in the **same** imported table.  
- PID-only linking remains best-effort under logon/session scope; prefer Sysmon GUIDs.  
- Sigma handoff opens the wizard with tab + filters prepared; it does not auto-start a Hayabusa scan.

## View Modes

The Process Inspector offers multiple view modes for different analysis workflows.

### Tree View Modes

| Mode | Filter | Clustering | Use Case |
|------|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Story** | Suspicious only | Clustered | Incident narrative — shows only flagged processes grouped by execution chain |
| **Triage** | Suspicious only | Clustered | Quick review of suspicious activity with deduplication |
| **Hunt** | Medium+ severity | Clustered | Broader sweep including medium-severity detections |
| **Raw** | All processes | Flat | Full unfiltered process list for manual analysis |

### Detection Table Modes

The detection results table has its own view modes:

| Mode | Filter | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Triage** | Suspicious only | Deduped, risk-sorted — highest-risk items first |
| **Review** | Medium+ severity | Broader view with deduplication |
| **Raw** | All items | Flat rows, no collapsing |

## Analyst Profile

The Analyst Profile lets you suppress known false positives and define environment baselines so the Process Inspector surfaces only actionable findings.

### Suppressions

Add suppression rules to hide known-good detections. Each suppression can match on:

- **Process name** — the detected process (e.g., `svchost.exe`)
- **Parent process name** — the parent in the chain
- **Hostname** — specific machine
- **User** — account context
- **Image path** — full executable path
- **Command line contains** — substring match on command line
- **Reason** — free-text justification for the suppression

### Baselines

Define baseline behaviors that are normal for your environment. Baseline rules use the same matching fields as suppressions.

### Persistence

- **Save** — export your analyst profile to a JSON file via **Save Profile**
- **Load** — import a previously saved profile via **Load Profile**
- Profiles persist across sessions and can be shared between analysts

## Custom Rules

Beyond the built-in detection library, you can extend detection coverage by defining custom detection rules within the Persistence Analyzer. Custom rules support regex patterns, severity levels, and MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping.

## Tips

::: tip Sysmon configuration
Log Process Create (1) with command lines, hashes, and (where licensed) Process Access (10). Include terminate (5) for lifetime rules.
:::

::: tip Large fleets
Use Story/Triage first, then Graph for spatial chains. When truncated, raise max processes or filter the tab by host/time before opening PI.
:::

::: tip Pivot, don’t re-hunt
**Filter Grid** + Related EVTX is usually faster than re-importing for process-scoped review.
