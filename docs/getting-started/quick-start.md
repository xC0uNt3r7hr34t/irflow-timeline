# Quick Start

Get up and running with your first timeline analysis in under a minute.

## Open a File

There are three ways to open a file:

1. **Menu:** File → Open (`Cmd+O`)
2. **Drag and drop:** Drag a file onto the application window
3. **Double-click:** Double-click a supported file in Finder

IRFlow Timeline will automatically detect the file format and begin streaming the import.

::: tip Files vs folders
**File → Open** selects *files* and offers the format filters — pick **All Files** to see
everything. It does not ingest plain folders. Directories are always chosen through the
workflow that understands them: **File → Open Triage Collection…** for a KAPE/triage
folder, **Tools → AI Artifacts** for an artifact root (`.claude`, `.codex`, `.gemini`,
ChatGPT app data, Windsurf `User`), and **Tools → Sigma** for an EVTX or rules directory.
Dragging a folder onto the window follows the same rules as File → Open.

## Capability Launcher

When no timeline tab is active, the home view shows **capability cards** — shortcuts into the main investigation workflows without hunting through menus first.

Each card opens the relevant analyzer or file dialog. Cards that need an imported tab (for example Process Inspector or IOC Matching) guide you to load data first; **Sigma · Hayabusa** and **Open & Explore** work immediately.

## Import Progress

![Import progress bar showing rows imported, file name, and streaming status while a large timeline loads](/dfir-tips/QuickStart-Import-Progress.png)

During import you will see:

- A progress bar showing rows imported
- Automatic delimiter detection for CSV/TSV files
- Sheet selection dialog for multi-sheet Excel files
- Column discovery for EVTX files

::: info Large Files
Files over 1GB may take a minute to import. The streaming architecture processes data in 128MB chunks with adaptive batch sizes (up to 100,000 rows per batch), so the UI remains responsive throughout. After import, column indexes and full-text search indexes build in the background — you can start working immediately.

## Navigate the Grid

Once imported, your data appears in a virtual-scrolling grid:

- **Scroll** through millions of rows smoothly — only ~10,000 rows are loaded at a time
- **Sort** by clicking any column header (click again to toggle ASC/DESC)
- **Resize columns** by dragging the column header borders
- **Pin columns** by `Cmd+Click` on a header and selecting Pin Left
- **Select rows** by clicking; hold `Shift` for range selection

## Search Your Data

Use the search bar at the top (`Cmd+F`):

1. Type your search term
2. Select a search mode from the dropdown:
   - **Mixed** — Combines full-text and substring search (default)
   - **FTS** — Full-text search (word-level matching)
   - **LIKE** — Substring match
   - **Fuzzy** — Tolerates typos
   - **Regex** — Regular expression patterns

Results update as you type (debounced at 500ms).

## Filter by Column

Click the filter icon on any column header to:

- **Text filter:** Type to match values in that column
- **Checkbox filter:** Select/deselect specific unique values
- **Date range:** For timestamp columns, pick a start and end date

## Bookmark Important Rows

Click the star icon on any row to bookmark it. Bookmarked rows are preserved across sessions and included in exported reports.

Toggle `Cmd+B` to show only bookmarked rows.

## Add Tags

`Cmd+Click` a row and select **Add Tag** to annotate it. Tags are color-coded and can be used for filtering and reporting. Common tags include:

- Suspicious
- Lateral Movement
- Exfiltration
- Persistence
- C2

## View the Histogram

Click the **histogram toggle** button in the toolbar to open the timeline visualization:

- See event distribution across days, hours, or minutes
- Click and drag to brush-select a time range — the grid filters automatically
- Color-coded by artifact source when using merged timelines

## Run a Detection Scan

Open the **Tools** menu to run analysis. Tools are grouped into four sections — **Analysis** (timeline-wide analytics and **AI Artifacts**), **Detection** (Sigma Scan and **AI Secret Hunt** on AI history tabs), **Platforms** (OS-specific forensics), and **Export** (HTML report and AI history packages).

![Tools → Analysis → AI Artifacts with Collect AI Artifacts and the AI Apps submenu for per-tool imports](/dfir-tips/Tools-Menu-AI-Artifacts.png)

![Tools → Detection with Sigma Scan and AI Secret Hunt (enabled on an AI Query History tab)](/dfir-tips/Tools-Menu-Detection-AI-Secret-Hunt.png)

Under **Platforms → Windows** you will find Process Inspector, Lateral Movement Tracker, Persistence Analyzer, RDP Bitmap Cache, and nested **Master File Table** / **USN Journal** menus for raw NTFS artifacts. Linux, macOS, and Cloud groups list upcoming analyzers as placeholders.

For AI-assisted activity, use **Tools → Analysis → AI Artifacts → Collect AI Artifacts** to merge local assistant stores into one tab, or open a single app under **AI Apps**. After import, run **Tools → Detection → AI Secret Hunt** on that tab. See [AI Query History](/dfir-tips/ai-query-history).

For a fast first pass on event logs, choose **Tools → Detection → Sigma Scan**. Point it at a folder of raw `.evtx` files (bundled Hayabusa engine) or at your current timeline tab (in-app JS Sigma engine), pick the **Fast high-confidence only** preset, and run — findings open in a MITRE ATT&CK-mapped triage dashboard. See [Sigma Detection](/features/sigma-detection) for the full workflow.

## Next Steps

- Learn about all [search modes and filters](/features/search-filtering)
- Set up [color rules](/features/color-rules) for visual pattern matching
- Run rule-based detection with [Sigma Detection](/features/sigma-detection)
- Explore the [Process Inspector](/features/process-tree) for Sysmon analysis (Story / Graph / Rules health / Filter Grid)
- Open a full KAPE folder with **File → Open Triage Collection…** ([KAPE workflow](/workflows/kape-integration#open-triage-collection))
- Track lateral movement with the [Lateral Movement Tracker](/features/lateral-movement)
- Configure [KAPE integration](/workflows/kape-integration) for auto-detection
