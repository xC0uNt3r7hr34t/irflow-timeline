## What's New · v1.0.12

- **Diff Tabs** — View → Diff Tabs compares any two imported files (EVTX, MFT, Prefetch, AI history, Computer History, or any CSV). The result is a color-coded Added / Removed / Changed timeline with field-level before/after and clickable status counts. Merge is a union; Diff is a comparison.
- **Tags and bookmarks stopped losing work** — annotations written during the post-import index build were being silently discarded; bulk tagging from the Actions menu ignored your selection and could tag the whole file; multi-row tagging untagged half a mixed selection; and select-all tagged exactly one row. Bulk Tag / Bookmark now leads with an explicit scope and its real row count, Manage Tags can rename, merge and truly delete a tag, and tags now survive CSV/XLSX export.
- **Signed disk image** — the DMG itself is now signed, notarized and stapled. Every release through 1.0.11 shipped an unsigned image that tripped Gatekeeper on download; that workaround is no longer needed.
- **Hayabusa v2 / v3 / v4** — the Sigma scanner detects the installed binary's version and builds the matching command line. Plus Select All / Clear for multi-source tab pickers, contributed by [@Yuds16](https://github.com/Yuds16).
- **Computer History re-audit** — `terminal.value_changed` (visible iTerm2 scrollback), Statsig account identity, and a corrected 48-hour purge caveat.

## What's New · v1.0.11

- **Computer History analysis verified against a live capture** — Credential rows are time anchors, not recovered passwords; capture fidelity is measured per application rather than assumed from the app's category; and gaps spanning a recorder restart are reported as unassessed instead of falsely cleared.
- **The copy that outlives the evidence** — Activity consolidated into `~/.codex/memories/` is neither purged at 48 hours nor cleared with Computer History, and is now collected. On a stale host it can be the only surviving record.
- **More of each summary** — The model-inferred user profile and carried-forward prior context become their own rows instead of being flattened into one blob.
- **Grok Build and Claude Desktop stores that outlive the conversation** — Deletion tombstones that date a removed chat, the files staged for upload to it, the Grok search index that mirrors a deleted session's text, and the app log that timestamps tool executions independently of it.
- **Sharper grid** — Mouse modifiers reach `KeyChord` (a command-click opens a link in a background tab), and click multiplicity is named by meaning rather than producing ten numeric Activity values.

## What is IRFlow Timeline?

Native macOS timeline analysis for DFIR — EVTX, KAPE super-timelines, and local AI artifacts in one app. Timeline Explorer–style workflow on Mac, plus built-in detection analytics and **AI Secret Hunt**.

### Who Is This For?

- **Incident Responders** — kill-chain reconstruction on macOS; review AI usage on triaged endpoints
- **SOC Analysts** — triage KAPE collections and hunt millions of events at native speed
- **Forensic Examiners** — MFT, Prefetch, Amcache, and registry in one unified timeline
- **Threat Hunters** — lateral movement detection, column stacking, and IOC sweeps
- **IR Consultants** — tagged, bookmarked evidence packages for client reporting
- **AI-assisted investigations** — collect local AI history, hunt pasted secrets, correlate with endpoint activity

Excel row limits, Windows VM overhead, or missing AI evidence — IRFlow is the macOS alternative to Timeline Explorer.

### Who Is This For?

- **Incident Responders** — reconstruct kill chains across endpoints on macOS, no Windows VM required
- **SOC Analysts** — triage KAPE collections and hunt through millions of event log entries at native speed
- **Forensic Examiners** — correlate MFT, Prefetch, Amcache, and registry artifacts in a single unified timeline
- **Threat Hunters** — detect lateral movement patterns, stack column values, and sweep IOC lists across your environment
- **IR Consultants** — deliver tagged and bookmarked evidence packages ready for client reporting

If you've hit Excel's 1M-row limit on a super-timeline, or you're tired of spinning up a Windows VM just to run Timeline Explorer — this is the tool that replaces both.

### Supported Formats

| Format | Extensions | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **CSV/TSV** | `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.txt`, `.log` | Auto-detects delimiters (comma, tab, pipe) |
| **Excel** | `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.xlsm` | Streaming reader (XLSX) + legacy binary parser (XLS) with sheet selection |
| **EVTX** | `.evtx` | Windows Event Log binary format; bounded 64 KiB chunk parsing up to the format's ~4 GiB limit |
| **Plaso** | `.plaso`, `.timeline` | Forensic timeline database (`.timeline` auto-detects; falls back to CSV) |
| **Raw $MFT** | `.mft` | NTFS Master File Table — direct import for NTFS analysis tools |
| **Raw $J** | `.$J`, `.usn` | NTFS USN Journal (change journal) |
| **AI app artifacts** | folders / JSONL / SQLite / LevelDB | Scan local AI history from supported desktop, CLI, and editor assistants |
| **ChatGPT Computer History** | Skysight `events.jsonl` segments + summary `.md` | macOS interaction telemetry — focus, clicks, keystrokes, selections, drags (own tab, 54-column schema) |

### Built for Scale

SQLite streaming import, lazy indexing, and virtual scrolling keep 30GB+ timelines responsive. Search millions of rows without freezing — memory-capped index builds and crash-safe long-running jobs.
